# Prompt templates
def make_faithfulness_prompt(golden: str, generated: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are an AI evaluator checking the faithfulness of a generated RAG answer against a golden reference answer.

The goal is to verify whether the generated answer correctly includes the people listed in the golden answer. You do **not** need to verify the details *about* the people ‚Äî only whether the **correct names** are included or omitted.

Golden Answer (reference list of people):
\"\"\"{golden}\"\"\"

Generated Answer:
\"\"\"{generated}\"\"\"

Instructions:
- Judge whether the expected people are mentioned.
- Do NOT penalize the answer for summarizing or changing the format of the information.
- If some expected names are missing, note them.
- If extra names appear (not in the golden answer), list them as hallucinations.
- Give a score between 0 and 10 based on how many correct names were retrieved.
- Special Case: If the list of expected resumes is empty, it means no resumes should be mentioned in the answer.
If any names appear in the answer, they must be treated as hallucinations and the score should be 0.

üí° **Scoring must be aligned with match coverage**:
- 0 = 0% of expected names mentioned
- 5 = ~50% of expected names mentioned
- 10 = All or nearly all expected names correctly mentioned

Return only a valid JSON with this format:

{{
  "score": <integer between 0-10>,
  "missing_info": "<comma-separated missing names or 'N/A'>",
  "noise": "<hallucinated names or 'N/A'>",
  "percent_matched": "<X% of expected names mentioned>"
}}
"""


def make_context_recall_prompt(golden: str, context: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are evaluating if the golden answer is properly supported by the retrieved context chunks.

The focus is on whether the context contains enough evidence to support the people listed in the golden answer ‚Äî even if the exact sentence or structure differs.

Golden Answer (expected people):
\"\"\"{golden}\"\"\"

Retrieved Context:
\"\"\"{context}\"\"\"

Instructions:
- Your job is NOT to judge the final answer ‚Äî only whether this context could have helped an LLM get the correct people.
- Identify any expected people missing from the context.
- Ignore formatting or paraphrasing.
- Give a score between 0 and 10 based on how well the context supports the golden answer.

üí° **Scoring must be aligned with match coverage**:
- 0 = 0% of expected names found in context
- 5 = ~50% of expected names found
- 10 = All or nearly all expected names clearly supported

Return only a valid JSON with this format:

{{
  "score": <integer between 0-10>,
  "missing_info": "<comma-separated missing names or 'N/A'>",
  "percent_matched": "<X% of golden names found in context>"

You are verifying whether the correct resume names were mentioned in a generated answer.

Expected Resume Names (from golden answer):
\"\"\"{names_list}\"\"\"

Generated Answer:
\"\"\"{answer_text}\"\"\"

Instructions:
- Check if the expected names or people are mentioned in the answer.
- Do NOT be strict on name formatting (e.g., "Neha Resume.pdf" ‚Üí "Neha" is fine).
- If some are missing, list them.
- If the answer mentions people who were not in the golden list, flag them as hallucinated.
- Do NOT be strict on name formatting (e.g., "Neha Resume.pdf" ‚Üí "Neha" is fine).
- Score from 0 to 10 based on how many expected names were retrieved.
- Special Case: If the list of expected resumes is empty, it means no resumes should be mentioned in the answer.
If any names appear in the answer, they must be treated as hallucinations and the score should be 0.
